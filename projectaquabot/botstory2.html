            <blockquote>
              <p>On September 14 2014 I received the OceanBot SierraBot-3 in the mail from Sara Spangelo and Ben Longmier of Pasadena, California. 
			  However, at the time I was in Boston visiting my second son Casey and his wife Satomi.</p>
			  <p>When I arrived home to my condo in the Naples/Marco Island area I unpacked the Bot and put in on my west lanai to charge and 
			  repair until September 24, which is when I dropped it off with the manager of a boat company at the docks at Naples bay. He handed it off 
			  to one of his boat captains who took it about 10 miles out into the gulf waters on September 26.</p>
			  <p>Much thanks to the manager and his boat captain for their help!</p>
			  <p>From there the Bot travelled about 25-30 miles out to sea and then turned around and came back to the same place it was 
			  dropped off on October 3rd. From there it travelled south to Big Marco Pass at high tide and thus was pushed into the pass 
			  on October 4th around 8pm and stopped reporting at midnight, having been beached.</p>

			   <p>Early Sunday morning I woke up and hurried to retrieve the Bot (without taking a shower) because I wanted to find it before 
			   anyone else did. "Hideaway Beach", where it landed, is a gated community, so after a bit of explaining I was able to get in and 
			   search the mangrove lined beach. After looking around, I decided that it was probably located within 100 feet east of a particular 
			   palm tree if it had not moved since midnight when it last reported.
			   So I removed my tennis shoes and waded out into the waters to get around the mangrove trees that had grown up to the waters edge.
			   After searching for a half hour I saw 3 people strolling along the beach toward me. I greeted them and asked if they may have 
			   seen the Bot on their stroll. They immediately were interested in helping me search. They were Judy Touhy of Chicago and Susie &
			   Harry Geier of Frankfurt, 
			   Germany. Susie was the one who found the Bot hiding in the tangled roots of the mangroves along the shore. She said she was 
			   good at searching for sea shells so her expertise was very helpful.
			   So the Bot was once again in my hands at 9:40 am on Sunday Oct 5 on the beach at Hideaway Beach on the most northern shores of 
			   Marco island.
			   Much thanks to Judy, Susie, and Harry for their time and help!</p>
			   <p>I took the Bot back to my condo to wipe out the minimal moisture on the inside and check it out for any leaks by a water 
			   submerge test.
			   After discussing where to release the Bot again with Ben we decided that the very south west tip of Marco Island might be 
			   a good place.
			   So that same day, Sunday Oct 5th, at 4:15 pm I released the Bot once more, this time at the south point of Cape Marco.  
			   It is now headed south toward the Florida Keys.
			   To be continued</p>
