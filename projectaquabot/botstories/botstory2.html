            <p>The Second Launch!  Sept 14, 2014, Naples, FL</p>
            <hr>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Ocean Bot SierraBot-3 was received in the mail from Sara Spangelo and Ben Longmier from Pasadena California by me
on September 14 2014 but I was in Boston visiting my second son Casey and his wife Satomi.
When I arrived home in the Naples/Marco Island area to my condo i unpackaged the Bot and put in on my west lanai to charge and repair until September 24 when I dropped it off with the manager of a boat company at the docks at Naples bay. He handed it off to one of his boat captains who took it about 10 miles out into the gulf waters on September 26.
Much thanks to the manager and his boat captain for their help!
From there the Bot traveled on its own to about 25-30 miles out and then turned around and came back to the same point it was dropped off on October 3rd. From there it traveled south to Big Marco Pass at high tide and thus was pushed into the pass on October 4th around 8pm and stopped reporting at midnight having been beached.
Early Sunday morning I woke up and hurried to retrieve the Bot without taking a shower being in a hurry to retrieve it before anyone else found it. "Hideaway Beach" where it landed is a gated community so I had some explaining to do to get in and search the mangrove lined beach. After getting in I located a particular palm tree and had a good idea that it should be within 100' east of that tree, if it had not moved since midnight when it last reported.
So I removed my tennis shoes and waded out into the waters to get around the mangrove trees that had grown up to the waters edge.
After searching for a half hour I saw 3 people walking toward me strolling the beach. I greeted them and asked if they may have seen the Bot on their stroll. They immediately were interested in helping me search. They were Judy touhy of Chicago and Susie & Harry Geier  of Frankfurt 
Germany and Susie was the one who found the Bot hiding in the tangled roots of the mangroves along the shore. She said she was good at searching for sea shells so her expertise was very helpful.
So the Bot was once again in my hands at 9:40 am on Sunday 5oct on the beach at Hideaway Beach on the most northern shores of Marco island.
Much thanks to Judy, Susie, and Harry for their time and help!
I took the Bot back to my condo to wipe out the minimal moisture on the inside and check it out for any leaks by a water submerge test.
After discussing where to release the Bot again with Ben we decided that at the very southwest tip of Marco Island might be a good place.
So that same day Sunday Oct 5th at 4:15 pm I released the Bot once more, this time at the south point of Cape Marco where it is now headed south toward the Florida Keys.
